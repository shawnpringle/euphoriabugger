==============

Example programs that causes the Euphoria to crash badly.  Crashes that are caused by segmentation faults and alike  
rather than crashes that are triggered by the interpreter detecting bad user supplied code.  

When empty, no program I know of and can have source code for does this.  Feel free to contribute items.  The exceptions include using the machine interface that cause a machine exception on purpose.
